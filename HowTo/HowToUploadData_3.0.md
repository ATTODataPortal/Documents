## 1. Create a dataset
<p align="justify">
The “Create” field, which is used to generate a dataset, is located in the second position in the top menu. (Figure 1):
</p>
<br>


![](https://github.com/ATTODataPortal/Documents/blob/aa23b79c4fc65acf03dd551d01db2834c724ebcd/images_upload_3.0/Create_1.png?raw=true)*Figure 1: Overview of "Create" menu for creating a dataset*
<br>
<p align="justify">
Click on “Create” to open a page with two templates to choose from. If primary data are to be uploaded as a structured dataset, the “Data” template needs to be selected. 
If files are to be uploaded to the data portal, select the “File” template.

It is advisable to always upload tabular data as a structured dataset, as this offers several advantages for the end user. Among other things, the variable and the respective values can be viewed. Furthermore, when downloading the dataset, information about the respective data structure, the metadata, if already published, the citation as a BibTex file and the metadata as an .xml file are also provided. 

In addition, the primary data can be selected and the respective selection can be downloaded using the download function in the “Data” tap.  
</p>

<p align="justify">
After selecting the respective template, you will be asked for the title and a description of the dataset (Figure 2). Both fields must be filled in to create the new dataset. 
The title of the respective data set should contain clear information about the content of the dataset and the year in which the primary data was collected. 
The description is the same as the abstract of the dataset. Both information is then automatically transferred to the metadata form and can be revised again at a later stage.
</p>
<br>

<br>

<p align="justify">
Once both fields have been completed, the dataset can be generated by clicking on the green plus sign located in the bottom right corner. Afterwards, the general editing page of the dataset appears (Figure 3). From here, there are various ways to continue working: 

- [Select an existing data structure](#2-select-an-existing-data-structure)
- [Upload data](#3-upload-data)
- [Edit the metadata](#3-metadata-form)
</p>

<br>
<br>

## 2. Select an existing data structure
<p align="justify">
Data structures contain all variables, which are part of the dataset to be uploaded. Prior to uploading a dataset, the data structure has to be defined in order to have a template for the upload process. Defined data structures can be used and should be used multiple times for long term data. This prevents that the same variable is defined several times with different names and units (e.g. time in seconds and in Universal time). This is essential to enable an extensive and consistent data management as well as exact search results. It is possible to create data structures for tabular (structured) data such as Excel tables, CSV-Files, text-files etc..
</p>
<p align="justify">
In the editing mode of the dataset, it can be created in the drop-down menu “Data Structure” before an upload. Furthermore,  it can be created from an uploaded file. These options should only be used by the data management team. 
We recommend that you select an existing data structure. Please send a request for a data structure including the header of your dataset with a clear description and the unit of each variable to the data management team (attodbm@bgc-jena.mpg.de). After the data management team has created the data structure, you will be informed of its name so that you can select it from the drop-down menu (Figure 4).
</p>

<br>
<br>

## 3 Upload data

### 3.1 Upload primary data
<p align="justify">
After selecting the respective data structure for the data set to be uploaded, you can import the primary data from a .csv, .xls, .txt or other data types in the next step. To do this, please use the “File Upload” section on the general editing page. Here, the file can either be selected from a directory by clicking on into the field or simply dragged and dropped into the field (Figure 5).
</p>
<br>

![](https://github.com/ATTODataPortal/Documents/blob/70666dd871648a1f987b904bb1a7a23f27495c09/images_upload_3.0/UploadFile_2.png?raw=true)*Figure 5: File upload and Validation menu.*
<br>
<p align="justify">
Figure 5 also shows the validation section. The green taps show the steps successfully completed for the upload. The taps highlighted in red show what still needs to be processed.
</p>
<p align="justify">
In this example, the assignment of the file reader information such as the separator between the respective data columns, the decimal separator, the definition of text in the file and the assignment of where variables, units and data can be found in the file is still missing. To activate this, click on “File Reader Information” in the “File Upload” section. The corresponding file for which the assignments are to be made can then be selected. This is the file that was previously added using drag'n'drop, for example (Figure 6).

<br>


<br>


### 3.2 Add attachments to datasets

<p align="justify">
The Attachments-tab (Figure 20) allows users, who have upload rights to dataset, to attach files such as descriptions as word document, text file, excel file, source code, images, etc. to the respective dataset. Other users can only see or download these attachments.

In order to add attachments to datasets, a brief description of the attachment should first be given (Figure 21). Then you can select a file from the local hard disk by clicking the "Select" button and upload it to the database by clicking the "Push" button (Figure 21).
</p>
<br>
<br>

![](https://github.com/ATTODataPortal/Documents/blob/510d7e5335b1eadb96fd0277d907db073552a89b/images_upload_3.0/Attachments_1.png?raw=true)*Figure 20: "Attachments"-tab in the dataset view*
<br>
<br>
<p align="justify">
If a file is successfully added as an attachment, it appears in the overview. Each individual attachment is assigned an ID. The file name, file type and file size are also listed (Figure 21). While moving the mouse pointer over the information icon, the previously entered description of the attachment is displayed. You can also add more than one attachment to one dataset.
</p>
<br>
<br>

![](https://github.com/ATTODataPortal/Documents/blob/7350254ed736c3088f82eb1dc39432444fa17714/images_upload/Attachements_4.png?raw=true)*Figure 21: "Attachments"-tab with uploaded file*
<br>
<br>

The attachments of a data set can be downloaded by clicking on the respective file name.
<br>




----------------------
<p align="justify">
The following section introduces the metadata schema for the ATTO consortium and gives an over-view of the individual information required.
In case you want to upload a new dataset to an existing data structure and comprehansive metadata information have thus already been uploaded previously, the respective metadata sheme can be requested from the data management team. You will receive a .xml file, which can be imported via the "Import" button (see Figure 5). You then have to change the appropriate information for your new dataset that differ from previous ones, such as collection dates, layers etc.
</p>
<br>

![](https://github.com/ATTODataPortal/Documents/blob/4cf133808ed0268b485c39ec934623c1d4503641/images_upload/image_Upload_5.png?raw=true)*Figure 5: Overview of metadata form*
<br>
<br>

The metadata structure contains four main sections:

- Dataset Level Metadata: Basic information on the data like title, abstract, owner, methods etc.
- Environmental Level Metadata: Detailed georeferenced information on the location, where the data were collected.
- Published In: DOI if dataset is already published in a data repository or in context of a scientific publication.
- Project: Information of the project, in which context the dataset was collected, including funding for the project.

<p align="justify">
Some fields are a free-text field, which have to be filled in by the data creator. Others have, drop-down menus and an autocomplete function that helps to fill in the form swiftly.
</p>
<br>

> `Note:` Completely filled metadata are essential for finding datasets within the ATTO data portal and allows an easy publishing process through the Max Planck Digital Library (MPDL).
<br>
<br>
<p align="justify">
Table 1 in the Appendix gives an overview and explanation of each variable of the metadata form. You also get this information by hovering the mouse pointer over the respective variable name left side of the text boxes and the green header of the subsections. All fields marked with a red asterisks * are mandatory for a valid metadata form.

After you complete the form, you can validate (see Figure 6) the entries and the system will give you further information in case any entries are wrong or whether more entries are required.
</p>
<br>

![](https://github.com/ATTODataPortal/Documents/blob/ea686fcf7c46edb7022a6be3b4071678f0db6214/images_upload/image_Upload_6.png?raw=true)*Figure 6: Bottom of Metadata form with "Validate" and “Save” button*  
<br>
<p align="justify">
When you completed and validated the metadata form, please click “Save” in order to finish the creation of the dataset. If there are metadata entries missing, the window shown in Figure 7 will pop up. In this case it is recommended that you click on “Cancel” to fill in the missing. However, while clicking on the “OK” button, the metadata form will be saved and you have the possibility to edit the form at a later point of time – even after primary data are already uploaded.
</p>
<br>

> `Note:` After a dataset is published with an assigned DOI, do not change any part of the dataset. Please contact the data management team (attodbm@mpi-mail.mpg.de) for help.

<br>
<br>

### 3.3 Upload_primary data
<p align="justify">
After the metadata form is saved, you will be automatically directed to the top of the page where you will find a link to the Primary Data and thus the Data Upload Wizard (see Figure 8 & 9). If you want to upload your data as tabular data (.xlsm, .txt, .csv) now, please click on the link. The term "Tabular data" is used for all datasets where the internal structure of the data is "known" to the system. For example, in a data table the header, which defines the columns (i.e. variables) is the structure of the data. Before uploading/importing data to the system the data structure needs to be created by the data management team (see also paragraph 2 - Defining a data structure).
</p>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<p align="justify">
First, please select an existing file containing your data. You can either select a file from your local computer or a file that has been uploaded to the server prior to starting the Data Upload Wizard (see Figure 10). The second option is designed for files larger than 4 MB that may take several minutes to transfer. The wizard supports file formats of Microsoft Excel (.xlsm) or ASCII (.txt, .csv). Once a file was successfully selected, click the "Next" button and proceed to the next step.
</p>
<br>

<br>
<br>

For all ASCII files you need to provide information on the formatting and file structure (Figure 11).

- Separator: Please choose which separator is used to separate data values from each other in the ASCII file.
- Decimal: Please choose the punctuation, which is used for decimal values. This is depending on your language settings of your computer.
- TextMarker: Please choose how text is marked in your data file.
- Orientation: Please choose if your data is oriented column-wise or row-wise.
- Offset: Define whether your dataset contain empty rows or columns on top or to the left before the header and the actual data values start.
- Variables: Please define the row/column where the header starts. Usually, datasets contain of a header, which defines variable names, types etc.
- Data: Please specify the row/column where the primary data starts.

More information can also be found in the online Help via “Data Collection”.

<br>
<br>
<p align="justify">
Next, the created data set must be specified once again, to which the data to be uploaded should be assigned.
</p>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<p align="justify">
After defining the required information, click “Next” and you are asked to validate your dataset (Figure 13). In this step, the system checks whether the header information and the number of variables matches with the predefined data structure. If this is the case, you will see the green stroke “Validated!!” on the top of the page. Please click “Next” to get a summary of your created dataset and to finalize the upload process by clicking “Finish”.
</p>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<p align="justify">
In case you want to upload your primary data at a later point of time and assign them to your prior defined metadata, you can use the "Upload" option via the "Collect" tab (Figure 1). Here you can chose as well, whether you want to upload tabular data or files like images or other data associated to your dataset (.avi, .bmp, .csv, .dbf, .doc, .docx, .gif, .jpg, .jpeg, .mp3, .mp4, .pdf, .png?raw=true, .shp, .shx, .tif, .txt, .xls, .xlsm, .xlsx, .xsd, .zip). The uploading process is similar to the application of the Upload Data Wizard described above.
</p>
<br>

### 3.4 Import_primary data
<p align="justify">
Using the Import Data Wizard is another possibility to create a dataset including metadata in one workflow. Please click "Import Data" via the “Collect” tab (Figure 1). After you selected a file from your local computer or a prior uploaded file, you have to choose the "ATTO" metadata schema. The title is by default the name of your file, but can be changed in the textbox "Title" (Figure 14).
</p>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<p align="justify">
You will be directed to a table, which represents your selected file. Here you can define which parts of the file contain the variables/header and which part are the primary data. Please select the row with variables/header and click the "Header" button (see Figure 15). The selected part will be highlighted in red. In order to specify the data, select multiple rows which contain the primary data and click the "Data" button (see Figure 15). If you want to skip some parts of your data you can just mark the rows above and below the respective parts. With the "Expand Selection" button you can expand the last selection of your data to the last row of the file. This is  recommended for large datasets
</p>
<br>

![](https://github.com/ATTODataPortal/Documents/blob/29f2f19fd71c170a0358e3fbcd9c0724d7a351ae/images_upload/import_data_3.png?raw=true)*Figure 15: Select areas in the Import Data Wizard*
<br>
<br>
<p align="justify">
You also have the option to import data from another worksheet of your file with the "Change Worksheet" button on the right side. Please note that only data from one sheet can be uploaded at a time.
</p>
<p align="justify">
When you finished the selection, click the "Next" button to proceed to the verification step, where you have to define the units and datatypes of the variables in the dataset you want to upload (Figure 16). A table with a dropdown menu shows you the variables in the dataset and provides you suggestions for the respective definition of units and datatypes based on other already uploaded datasets. While choosing one of the suggestions, the respective unit and datatype are automatically filled in. You also can define these attributes by yourself by entering free text. With the "Validate" button (see Figure 16) you can verify whether the selected datatypes are suitable for the dataset or if you have to adjust a particular specification.
</p>
<p align="justify">
With a click on the "Next" button you can proceed to a summary of your upload process, which provides an overview of your dataset. Please click the "Finish" button and the data structure and the dataset will be created. In the next step, you will be redirected to the new dataset and you can fill in the metadata form as described in section 3.2 Metadata.
</p>

<br>
<br>

### 3.5 Push big file
<p align="justify">
In case you want to upload a big file, you can use the "Push Big File" option via the "Collect" tab. Datasets with the following formats are supported: .avi, .bmp, .csv, .dbf, .doc, .docx, .gif, .jpg, .jpeg, .mp3, .mp4, .pdf, .png?raw=true, .shp, .shx, .tif, .txt, .xls, .xlsm, .xlsx, .xsd, .zip.

<br>
<p align="justify">
Each registered user can upload files to a personal folder where files are stored temporary. An overview of these files is given on the left side of the Push Big File Wizard (see Figure 17). You can delete these files by clicking on the small bin next to the file name. For uploading a dataset, please click on the “Select” button to select a file from your local computer and then click “Push” .
</p>
<br>

### 3.6 Add data or update dataset
<p align="justify">
The system allows to add data to an already existing dataset or to update datasets in case the processing standard was updated. The first case might mainly apply for continuous measurements of time series like temperature profiles or radiation etc. and allows extending the already uploaded time series with the fresh data.

Please click on the "Collect2 tab in the main menu (see Figure 1) and choose "Upload Data". In the Upload Data Wizard you first have to choose whether your data are tabular data or a file.
</p>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<p align="justify">
The file selection is same as described in section 3.3 Upload primary data. After you selected your data/file either from your local computer (or from the server in case it was uploaded before) the file information have to be defined (see section 3.3 Figure 11). In the next step, please specify the dataset to which the uploaded data should be added. A list of all datasets (dataset-ID and title) is shown in a dropdown menu (Figure 19).
</p>
<br>

![](https://github.com/ATTODataPortal/Documents/blob/b89a6644b8f2850e6c3ce984b456b09b9604c58d/images_upload/update_data_2.png?raw=true)*Figure 19: Upload Data Wizard - specify dataset*
<br>
<br>
<p align="justify">
Click next and define the primary keys of the dataset to be uploaded. Please check the selected variables before clicking next. In case all primary keys are defined accordingly, they are displayed in green in the upper right corner of the webpage. 

Click "Next" and you are asked to validate your dataset. In this step, the system checks whether the header information and the number of variables matches with the predefined data structure. If this is the case, you will see the green stroke "Validated!!" on the top of the page. Please click "Next" to get a summary of your created dataset and to finalize the upload process by clicking "Finish".
</p>
<br>

> `Note:` A dataset ID and a dataset version ID are assigned to the uploaded datasets. During each change of the metadata and/or the primary data, the dataset version ID is updated while the dataset ID is always the same. However, all dataset versions are stored on the server. Furthermore, while downloading data, the dataset version ID is taken into account. Please consider the change of datasets before publishing the dataset with assigned DOI since the link to the DOI has to be updated as well after this process. Further information regarding data publication can be found in a separate document.
