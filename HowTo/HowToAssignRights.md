## 1 Set dataset permissions

<p align="justify">
The Dashboard gives an overview table of all datasets you created or you have rights to as registered user. Details of each dataset can be found by clicking on the small eye-icon in the very right column of your Dashboard, (Figure 1).
</p>

<br>
<br>

<p align="justify">
You will be directed to the main page of the chosen dataset, where details on Metadata, Primary Data, Data Structure, Dataset Permissions, publication and attachments are given in different tabs. Each user is allowed to see the metadata of each dataset independent of the respective rights. If users have rights on the dataset, they are allowed to edit and copy the metadata, to check and download primary data, to see the data structure and dataset permission.
As data owner, you can grant rights to each registered user or to groups of users as explained below. First, please click on the “Dataset Permission” tab (Figure 2).
</p>
<br>

<br>
<br>

<p align="justify">
You will be redirected to an overview page, where a list with all users, the respective subject type
and the permissions for “Read”, “Write”, “Delete”, and “Grant” are shown (Figure 3). “Read” rights
also include the right to download the respective dataset. As data owner, you automatically have the
rights for all four categories as indicated by activated checkboxes behind your name. First, it is
recommended to give all owners of the dataset the same rights by activating the checkboxes behind
the respective names.
</p>
<p align="justify">
However, you can choose whether users get all or just some limited rights. According to the ATTO
consortium Data Policy, all members of the ATTO consortium should have the right to read (and
download) datasets collected within the project. For this, the internal “ATTO Consortium” group was
created. All other registered external users are automatically member of the “External users” group.
In case your data should be available to the consortium, please assign the rights to read this dataset
to the “ATTO Consortium” group by activating the respective checkboxes (Figure 3).
</p>
<br>
<br>

> `Note:` You can change rights at any time as long as you have the admin rights of your dataset. If you
lose rights, please contact the data management team (attodbm@mpi-mail.mpg.de).

## 2 Assign rights to requested datasets

### 2.1 Request datasets

<p align="justify">
In case users are interested in a specific dataset, which is not publicly available, this specific dataset
can be requested via the “Request Access” button in the data overview section (Figure 4). By
clicking on it, a request is made to the data owners, who are informed of the request by e-mail. A list
of the open requests will be displayed in the “Decisions” section of the dashboard of the respective
data owner.
</p>
<br>

<p align="justify">
A successfully sent request is marked with a grayed out Request button with the inscription "Request has been made" (Figure 5). Once the data owner accepts the request, the user who made the request is automatically granted read and thus download rights.
</p>

<br>
<br>

### 2.2 Grant rights to datasets by accepting requests

<p align="justify">
If a dataset request has been made, the registered data owner receives an e-mail with the following wording: “User "username" send a request for Dataset "dataset title" with id (“dataset id”)”. In this case, the data owner can first contact the respective user and ask for background information on the planned use of the data.
</p>
<p align="justify">
If the requesting user is to be assigned read, and thus download rights to the respective dataset, the request can be accepted in the Dashboard under "Decisions". On the right side you find a box with a checkmark. If this box is black, it indicates an open request (Figure 6).
</p>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

<p align="justify">
To accept the request you can click on the box and a window will open in which you have to click on "OK" to finally accept the request (Figure 7).
</p>
<br>

<br>
<br>

<p align="justify">
As soon as you have agreed with "OK", the read rights are automatically assigned to the requesting user and the box with the check mark is now highlighted in white (Figure 8).
