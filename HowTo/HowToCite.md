## 1 How to credit data

### 1.1 Why to cite a dataset
<p align="justify">
Why a dataset must also be cited can be found on the DataCite website at the following link:
</p>

[DataCite - Why is it so important to cite data](https://datacite.org/cite-your-data.html)


### 1.2 How to cite a dataset
<p align="justify">
In accordance with DataCite requirements, we ask to cite a dataset as follows.

`List of data owners/data creators separated by comma (Creation date): Title. [Resource Type which is "Dataset"]. Publisher, which is Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry. For internal data: URL of the repository, which is "https://www.attodata.org/". ID of the dataset with a leading "Dataset ID ="  / For public data: URL or DOI of the dataset.`
<br>
</p>
<br>

**Example for internal data:**
<p align="justify">
Barbosa, C., Taylor, P., Sebben, B., & Godoi, R. (2022). Giant Bioaerosol Particles over the rainforest (2015-2019) [Data set]. Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry. https://www.attodata.org/. Dataset ID = 330.9.1354 
</p>
<br>

**Example for public data (DOI):**
