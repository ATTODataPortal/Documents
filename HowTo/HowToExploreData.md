## 1 Search User Interface

<p align="justify">
After logging into the ATTO data portal, you will be automatically directed to the Search User Interface (UI, Figure 1). You can navigate back to the search function from any other subpage by clicking "Search" in the menu bar at the top of the site. By default, the search shows all available datasets. By activating the check mark "public only", only publically available datasets are displayed (Figure 2).
