## 1 Search User Interface

<p align="justify">
After logging into the ATTO data portal, you will be automatically directed to the Search User Interface (UI, Figure 1). You can navigate back to the search function from any other subpage by clicking "Search" in the menu bar at the top of the site. By default, the search shows all available datasets. By activating the check mark "public only", only publically available datasets are displayed (Figure 2).

<p align="justify">
The main nodes of the Search UI are based on metadata entered. Thus, completely filled metadata are essential for finding datasets within the ATTO data portal.
</p>
<br>
<p align="justify">
The Search UI contains of the following features, which help to filter uploaded data according to owners, location, keywords, etc.:
</p>
<br>

- <p align="justify">Categories/Facets: The main categories like “Person”, “Location”, etc. are based on main metadata entries. The numbers next to the categories indicate the number of existing datasets in the ATTO data portal with the respective entries.</p>

- <p align="justify">Properties: This function allows to use predefined dropdown components to filter datasets according to properties. There is only one possible choice for every component. Results and facets are updated accordingly.</p>

- <p align="justify">Free text search: In the free text search, you can either search for keywords in all predefined categories or you can choose a specific category from the dropdown menu on the left. It uses autocomplete for predicting words and phrases once three letters are entered.</p>

- <p align="justify">Filter: Filter datasets in order to display records, which match certain criteria. The filter can be activated/deactivated by clicking on the filter-symbol next to the respective category. You can filter data for self-defined values and choose different queries like “Is equal to”, “Is not equal to”, “Starts with”, “Contains”, etc.</p>

- <p align="justify">Results: The matching results are displayed in a table view, where basic functions like filtering, sorting, paging are available in the header of the table. By clicking right on the header, you can choose the visibility of the individual columns. By clicking on the respective header caption, the sorting function is activated. You also can define the number of displayed datasets per page via the grey box at the top and the bottom of the table.</p>
