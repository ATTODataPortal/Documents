## 1 Overview

<p align="justify">
The ATTO data portal is the main tool for data sharing within the ATTO consortium and for external
researchers. This step by step tutorial will show you how to register for the ATTO data portal.
</p>
<br>

## 2. Access to the ATTO data portal
<br>
The ATTO data portal can be accessed via the URL www.attodata.org.
<br>
<br>
There are two options to enter the portal.

<p align="justify">
1. “Login” (Figure 1): As ATTO consortium member, one should be a registered user of
the ATTO data portal. How to register is explained below.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Registered users can explore the datasets uploaded to the data portal via metadata
information and can upload datasets collected at the ATTO field site. Datasets, which are
open accessible for the entire consortium can be downloaded by all users belonging to the
internal group called “ATTO Consortium”. These users also have access to internal
information on the ATTO field site and contacts. Registered users who cooperate with the
project, but are not members of the ATTO consortium, do not have access to these data.
Access can be requested if required.
</p>
<br>
<p align="justify">
2. “Continue without Login” (Figure 1): This option is for external users in order to get
an overview of available datasets. Therefore, only the metadata and information on the data
structure are accessible. The primary data are not freely available, except datasets which are
already published via Max Planck Digital Library (MPDL) including a DOI.
</p>

## 3. Registration on the ATTO data portal
<br>
<p align="justify">
For registration, please click on the “Register” button (Figure 1) at the landing page of
www.attodata.org. You will be directed to a form where a User Name, your e‐mail address and a selfchosen
password has to be entered.
</p>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<p align="justify">
All fields have to be filled in. The “Terms and Conditions” and the “Data Policy” of the ATTO
consortium, has to be accepted. Please click on the grey stroke “Terms and Conditions”/ “Data
Policy” (Figure 2) and read it carefully. The sections “Specifically as A DATA CONTRIBUTOR, I
agree to:” and “As a DATA USER, I agree to:” have to be read carefully as well and have to be ticked
in order to be able to register. These points are the most important points of the data policy, but this
does not mean that the data policy itself does not need to be read.
</p>
After pressing the “Register” button an e‐mail with an authentication link will be send to the given e-mail
address (Figure 3).

Check your e‐mail account and follow the given link for confirmation in order to finalize the
registration process. You will be directed to a further form where you have to fill in further details
about you, such as your institution, which will be used to manage users and groups within the ATTO
data portal (Figure 4). Fields marked with a red asterisk (Figure 4) are mandatory. However,
we suggest completing the other information as well, to improve communication within the
consortium. Please indicate whether you are an ATTO consortium member by clicking “True” in the
field “ATTO Member” (Figure 4) or “False” if you are an external user. Furthermore, please
enter your e‐mail address and the institute you are affiliated to.

After completion click the “Save” button (Figure 4) and log in with your prior defined
credentials.

When the registration is completed, the data management team will assign the rights to your user
profile within the next working days and send you a confirmation e‐mail.
